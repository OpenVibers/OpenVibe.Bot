# OpenVibe.Bot

The open control panel for robots (openvibe.bot). Design: OpenVibe.Contracts docs/adr/ADR-043-bot-devices-and-control.md; plan track T15.

## Deploy

Production runs the Node process under systemd as `openvibe-bot.service` (unit reference: `deploy/systemd/openvibe-bot.service`), with `WorkingDirectory=/opt/openvibe.bot`, `ExecStart` running `server/index.js`, and secrets/config read from the environment file `/etc/openvibe/bot.env`. The app listens on port **4630** behind nginx (`deploy/nginx/openvibe.bot.conf`), which terminates TLS and upgrades the `/device` and `/control` WebSockets to `127.0.0.1:4630`. Readiness is `http://127.0.0.1:4630/api/ready` (liveness: `/api/health`); both are loopback-only.

To run the schema migrations before the service serves, start it once with the direct owner connection in `/etc/openvibe/bot.env` (`DATABASE_DIRECT_URL`); the boot applies `migrations/` and then serves on the pooled `DATABASE_URL`.

## Deploy files

- `deploy/systemd/openvibe-bot.service` — systemd unit (`EnvironmentFile=/etc/openvibe/bot.env`, `PORT=4630`, hardening and `Restart=always`).
- `deploy/nginx/openvibe.bot.conf` — nginx reference site for openvibe.bot: TLS, www→apex, rate limits, and WebSocket upgrade headers for the device (`/device`) and operator (`/control`) sockets, passing the `Authorization` header through. It serves the existing Sites page from `/opt/openvibe.sites/dist/openvibe.bot` and shared assets from `/opt/openvibe.sites/dist/_shared`.

Before installing this vhost, the OpenVibe.Sites owner must stop its catalog and deploy pipeline from generating or replacing `/etc/nginx/sites-available/openvibe.bot.conf`, while continuing to publish the page and shared assets at the paths above. Coordinate the single vhost handoff with that owner; then install this config, validate nginx, and reload it after `openvibe-bot.service` is ready. A later Sites deploy must not overwrite Bot's `/device` and `/control` routes.
